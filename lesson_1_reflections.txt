first reflection:

Q How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it helped a lot.
I learnt how to start sublime from the cmd line, and how to create a file and open it. handy

Q How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

being able to see your combined work over a period of time, to ave access to old code that you might actuall of needed

Q What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

it would personally be more useable for me and it would likely lead to complications with broken code

Q Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

firstly because git is aimed at coders. and secondly it is not really needed in gdocs
